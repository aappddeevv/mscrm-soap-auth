This is a slightly tweaked version of authentication using SOAP to CRM
that was taken from [https://github.com/jlattimer/CRMSoapAuthJava.git](https://github.com/jlattimer/CRMSoapAuthJava.git)
and [https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/girishr/2011/02/04/connecting-to-crm-online-2011-web-services-using-soap-requests-only](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/girishr/2011/02/04/connecting-to-crm-online-2011-web-services-using-soap-requests-only).

It was updated for scala and dispatch. Because the example now uses
scala's XML literal syntax, the SOAP templates are also much clearer.
